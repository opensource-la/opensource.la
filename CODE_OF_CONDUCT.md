# Code of Conduct

## Principles

OpenSource.la is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We
do not tolerate harassment of OpenSource.la participants in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks,
workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption
of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention.

**Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.**

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the OpenSource.la organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from OpenSource.la. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
OpenSource.la staff immediately.

## Communication

**In addition to the principles outlined above, participants are also asked to
refrain from recruiting, or self promotion, through OpenSource.la communications.** Because demand for
developers greatly outstrips supply, allowing recruiting or self promotion through OpenSource.la
would reduce the quality of the community and its discussions.

If a post does happen that is deemed appropriate by an organizer we will remove
the post immediately with a reminder of the code of conduct. If a participant
or organization is found to have repeat postings, they will be promptly removed
from the OpenSource.la community.
